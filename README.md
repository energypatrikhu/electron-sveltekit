## Welcome
This repository is a template for [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) with [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/).

The base was created with [electron-vite](https://github.com/alex8088/electron-vite).

The included `Svelte` version was replaced by `SvelteKit` with  `Svelte 5`.

## Installation
```bash
npx degit energypatrikhu/electron-sveltekit my-new-app
cd my-new-app
npm install --force
```

`--force` is needed because peer dependencies are not met by the template, and the installation will fail without it.
